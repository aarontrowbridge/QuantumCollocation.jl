# Problem Templates

We provide a number of problem templates for making it simple and easy to set up and solve certain types of quantum optimal control problems. These templates all construct a `QuantumControlProblem` object.  The problem templates are:

## Unitary Smooth Pulse Problem

```@docs

```

## Unitary Minimum Time Problem
